## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
- Java

### Project Description
- Implement a distributed database with multiversion concurrency control, deadlock detection, replication, and failure recovery. 
- deep insight of the design of a distributed system. 
- compare/evaluate strategy for concurrency, deadlock detection and failure recovery with existing other systems.

## Build the project using Gradle
- command: gradlew clean build
- It creates a directory 'build' in project directory
 
## Run the program using Gradle
- command: gradlew run

## Run the program from build
- You will get a jar file named "RepCRec-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" in build/libs directory 
- command: java -jar RepCRec-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

## ALGORITHMS USED
